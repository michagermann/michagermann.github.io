Much of that history has been violent. New nation-states often come from the violent dissolution of larger states or empires and violence has earned many nations the right to exist as sovereign entities. Indeed, most armed conflicts since the end of the Cold War have been about self-determination. A large literature in political science and economics has tried to identify the causes of secessionist war and explain the genesis of self-determination movements. However, a core limitation had been that data on self-determination movements is heavily incomplete, overrepresenting highly mobilized, violent movements. The first version of the SDM dataset provided improved data on self-determination movements (SDMs) around the world that corrects the selection bias that characterized previous efforts to code SDMs. It also included more detailed data on group attributes and state-movement interactions for a random subset of movements.\nSDM 2.0 updates and extends the original dataset. SDM 2.0 identifies a total of 502 self-determination movements in 124 countries between 1945 and 2020. The new data includes time-varying information on the exact claims made by all 502 self-determination movements, their involvement in armed conflict with the state, state-movement interactions, and a range of group attributes. Via the GeoSDM extension (Germann, Puglia, and Schvitz 2025), SDM 2.0 also provides geo-spatial data identifying the territories claimed by all 502 self-determination movements, as well as data on a range of attributes of these territories, such as their size, the proximity to international land borders, and their economic value. All coding decisions are justified in an extensive set of coding notes, which is made available as part of the dataset.\nSDM 2.0 will be made publicly available after the publication of the first article based on the new dataset. Please e-mail me if you would like to negotiate early access.\nIn the meantime, selected data can be inspected here. You can find the codebook here.\nSDM 2.0 was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (grant reference: ES/W000598/1).\n","date":1766448000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1766448000,"objectID":"fc71f9234da74515f4387abd51f5deda","permalink":"https://michagermann.github.io/data/sdm2/","publishdate":"2019-09-14T18:19:30+01:00","relpermalink":"/data/sdm2/","section":"data","summary":"Updated and extended data on self-determination movements, 1945-2020","tags":null,"title":"SDM 2.0","type":"data"},{"authors":["Micha Germann","Iulia Cioroianu","Fernando Mendez","Constantinos Djouvas"],"categories":["Unpublished"],"content":"","date":1766361600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1766361600,"objectID":"5d9042fe707a1beae62d255a92bc4adb","permalink":"https://michagermann.github.io/publication/germannetal_vaaeffects/","publishdate":"2025-12-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/germannetal_vaaeffects/","section":"publication","summary":"Assessing VAA effects using a new experimental design.","tags":[],"title":"Do Voting Advice Applications Have Lasting Causal Effects?

While it is often assumed that violent and nonviolent conflicts are qualitatively different and have different causes, that assumption is rarely tested empirically. This article uses a two-step approach to explore whether political exclusion and lost autonomy -- two common causes of civil war according to extant literature -- are associated with the emergence of nonviolent separatist claims, with the escalation of nonviolent separatist claims to war, or both. Our analysis suggests that different types of grievances matter more at different stages of conflict escalation. We find that political exclusion is a significant correlate of the escalation of nonviolent claims for self-determination to violence, while its association with the emergence of nonviolent separatist claims is weaker. By contrast, lost autonomy is correlated with both the emergence of nonviolent separatist claims and, if autonomy revocations are recent, their escalation to violence. We argue that these results are consistent with both grievance- and opportunity-based theories of conflict.","tags":[],"title":"Political Exclusion, Lost Autonomy, and Escalating Conflict over Self-Determination","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Micha Germann"],"categories":["Published"],"content":"","date":1609545620,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609545620,"objectID":"003f7382286065b0de0e79125e0d6520","permalink":"https://michagermann.github.io/publication/germann2021/","publishdate":"2019-09-14T18:19:30+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/germann2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Cross-border migration has increased rapidly in recent decades. In response, most democracies have extended voting rights to their citizens abroad. Nevertheless, expatriate voter turnout tends to be low. This article investigates a frequently proposed remedy - internet voting - based on a case study of extended internet voting trials in eight Swiss cantons. For causal identification, I exploit an unexpected federal intervention that led to a temporary suspension of internet voting in four of the eight cantons, during which expatriates could vote only by mail. Using difference-in-differences estimation, I find that the temporary suspension of internet voting decreased turnout among registered expatriate voters by 4.1 to 6.4 percentage points. Placebo tests suggest that pre- and post-suspension trends in expatriate voter turnout were close to identical in treated and control cases. Overall, the results of this study suggest that internet voting represents an effective method to increase electoral participation among citizens abroad. Still, expatriate voter turnout remained well-below domestic turnout even with internet voting available, suggesting that high voting costs are not the only reason why citizens abroad tend to vote at lower rates.","tags":[],"title":"Internet Voting Increases Expatriate Voter Turnout","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Micha Germann"],"categories":["Published"],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"da42ad74e063ee3ed09d8e02135d5007","permalink":"https://michagermann.github.io/publication/germann2020/","publishdate":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/germann2020/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper reassesses the claim that electronic voting systems help voters to avoid common mistakes that lead to their votes remaining uncounted. While prior studies have come to mixed conclusions, I provide new, more robust evidence based on a case study of extended Internet voting trials in Geneva canton, Switzerland. The trials almost exclusively involved referendum votes. For causal identification I exploit the unique circumstance that federal safety legislation created a near-natural experiment, with some of the canton’s municipalities participating in the trials and others not. Using difference-in-differences estimation, I find that the residual vote rate decreased by an average of 0.3 percentage points if municipalities offered the possibility to vote online in addition to (mostly optically scanned) paper ballots. For cantonal measures, which are located towards the bottom of ballot papers in Geneva, the reduction increases to 0.5 percentage points. These remain relatively modest effects, and I find no evidence for a knock-on effect on electoral outcomes. However, on average only around 20% of votes were cast online where the opportunity existed, and online voting was most popular among voters with high levels of education. Despite the small effect sizes, the results of this study therefore point to the potential of Internet and, more generally, electronic voting technology to reduce avoidable voter mistakes.","tags":[],"title":"Making Votes Count with Internet Voting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Micha Germann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1583798400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583798400,"objectID":"3cb88305368c6136044eae2c120dc56f","permalink":"https://michagermann.github.io/outreach/democraticaudit2020/","publishdate":"2020-03-10T18:19:30+01:00","relpermalink":"/outreach/democraticaudit2020/","section":"outreach","summary":"Blog contribution for [*Democratic Audit*](https://www.democraticaudit.com/2020/03/10/how-internet-voting-could-help-to-make-more-votes-count/)","tags":null,"title":"How Internet Voting Could Help to Make More Votes Count","type":"outreach"},{"authors":["Micha Germann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1583366400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583366400,"objectID":"f617268c9dfecfb311e48e96da7823ae","permalink":"https://michagermann.github.io/outreach/pobe2020/","publishdate":"2020-03-25T18:19:30+01:00","relpermalink":"/outreach/pobe2020/","section":"outreach","summary":"Blog contribution for [*Political Behavior Blog*](https://politicalbehavior.wordpress.com/2020/03/05/making-votes-count-with-internet-voting/)","tags":null,"title":"Making Votes Count with Internet Voting","type":"outreach"},{"authors":["Iulia Cioroianu","Micha Germann","Jonathan Wheatley"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1574640000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574640000,"objectID":"d06d3a1a277feb531de92740bd982974","permalink":"https://michagermann.github.io/outreach/inews2019/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T18:19:30+01:00","relpermalink":"/outreach/inews2019/","section":"outreach","summary":"Article in [*i News*](https://inews.co.uk/news/who-to-vote-for-in-the-2019-general-election-why-voting-advice-applications-help-get-out-the-vote-1321714)","tags":null,"title":"Why Voting Advice Applications Help Get out the Vote","type":"outreach"},{"authors":["Micha Germann","Nicholas Sambanis"],"categories":null,"content":"Description Influential contributions posit that centralization and the imposition of direct rule constitute key causes of the emergence of separatist nationalism and the escalation of separatist claims to violence.

We argue that an observational approach utilizing survey data constitutes the best available method for causal inference where VAAs are popular—and we are thus most interested in VAA turnout effects—because randomized experiments are likely to run into double cross-over problems. We suggest that matching offers key improvements over existing methods to tackle self-selection into VAA use in observational studies. To improve confidence in selection on observables, we complement matching estimates with an extensive sensitivity analysis, including a placebo test. Empirically, we study the effect of smartvote, a popular VAA from Switzerland, on turnout in the 2007 Swiss federal election. We find that smartvote usage significantly increased the individual-level probability to vote. Our results suggest that smartvote was, on the aggregate, responsible for about 1.2 % points of the total tally with an estimated cost of nine Swiss Francs (7.5 U.S. dollars or 1.4 `Big Macs') per additional vote. Promising as well, we find that the mobilization effect was more pronounced among younger voters.

We demonstrate the usefulness of the new data set by revisiting Barbara Walter’s influential argument that governments will not accommodate SD challengers if they face several potential future challengers down the road because they want to build a reputation for strength. We do not find support for Walter’s reputational theory of separatist conflict.","tags":[],"title":"SDM: A New Data Set on Self-determination Movements with an Application to the Reputational Theory of Conflict","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fernando Mendez","Micha Germann"],"categories":["Published"],"content":"","date":1515974400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1515974400,"objectID":"f246a99c978efe0a411c607b3bfd11cf","permalink":"https://michagermann.github.io/publication/mendezgermann2018/","publishdate":"2019-09-14T18:19:30+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/mendezgermann2018/","section":"publication","summary":"The recent proliferation of referendums on sovereignty matters has fuelled growing scholarly interest.

Much of that history has been violent. New nation-states often come from the violent dissolution of larger states or empires and violence has earned many nations the right to exist as sovereign entities. Indeed, most armed conflicts since the end of the Cold War have been about self-determination. A large literature in political science and economics has tried to identify the causes of secessionist war and explain the genesis of self-determination movements. However, a core limitation has been that extant sources of data on self-determination movements are heavily incomplete and overrepresent highly mobilized, violent movements.\nThe SDM dataset provides new and improved data on self-determination movements (SDMs) around the world that corrects the selection bias that characterizes previous efforts to code SDMs. The SDM data identifies more than 450 ethnic groups that have made claims for increased territorial self-determination from 1945-2012. This is more than double the number covered in existing datasets; and whereas up to 60% of the cases included in existing datasets are violent, more than two thirds of the cases we code never escalated to violence. For a random sample of cases, SDM in addition provides detailed information on government policy responses to SDMs as well as on several attributes of SDM groups including group sizes, regional concentration, and overlap of the claimed territory with hydrocarbon reserves. The data is supported by extensive documentation and can be used to study the causes of self-determination claims, the escalation of nonviolent self-determination claims to violence, how governments respond to ethnic claims for self-determination, and other theoretical arguments concerning separatist conflict that have previously been tested with incomplete or inferior data.\nThe data and documentation can be downloaded here.\nWhen referring to this data set, please always cite:\nSambanis, Nicholas, Micha Germann, and Andreas Schädel (2018). ``SDM: A New Dataset on Self-Determination Movements with an Application to the Reputational Theory of Conflict.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; Journal of Conflict Resolution 62(3):656\u0026ndash;686.

Which configuration of political institutions produces the highest democratic quality is a notorious debate. The lineup of contenders includes ‘consensus’, ‘Westminster’, and ‘centripetal’ democracy. A trend in the evaluation of the relationship between empirical patterns of democracy and its quality is that the multidimensional nature of both concepts is increasingly taken into account. This article tests the assertion that certain centripetal configurations of proportionality in party systems and government, and unitarism in the remaining state structure, might outperform all other alternatives both in terms of inclusiveness and effectiveness. Analyzing 33 democracies, the results of interactive regression models only partially support this claim. Proportional–unitary democracies have the best track record in terms of representation, but there are little differences in participation, transparency, and government capability compared with other models.","tags":[],"title":"Taking the Multidimensionality of Democracy Seriously: Institutional Patterns and the Quality of Democracy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Micha Germann","Fernando Mendez"],"categories":["Published"],"content":"","date":1462060800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1462060800,"objectID":"11a13a98fb8db1627f884bc0dcfe1266","permalink":"https://michagermann.github.io/publication/germannmendez2016/","publishdate":"2019-09-14T18:19:30+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/germannmendez2016/","section":"publication","summary":"Voting advice applications (VAAs), online tools that provide voters with an estimate of their ideological congruence with political parties or candidates, have become increasingly popular in recent years. Many VAAs draw on low-dimensional spatial representations to match voters to political elites. Yet VAA spatial maps tend to be defined purely on a priori grounds. Thus fundamental psychometric properties, such as unidimensionality and reliability, remain unchecked and potentially violated. This practice can be damaging to the quality of spatial matches. In this paper we propose dynamic scale validation (DSV) as a method to empirically validate and thereby improve VAA spatial maps. The basic logic is to draw on data generated by users who access the VAA soon after its launch for an evaluation (and potential adjustment) of the spatial maps. We demonstrate the usefulness of DSV drawing on data from three actual VAAs: ParteieNavi, votulmeu and choose4cyprus.","tags":[],"title":"Dynamic Scale Validation Reloaded: Assessing the Psychometric Properties of Latent Measures of Ideology in VAA Spatial Maps","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fernando Mendez","Micha Germann"],"categories":null,"content":"Description Referendums on sovereignty have proliferated in recent years and are increasingly catching the interest of political scientists. A growing literature examines the conditions leading to referendums on sovereignty matters, whether sovereignty referendums help to resolve conflicts peacefully, and various other outcomes of sovereignty referendums.

This is where the Contested Sovereignty dataset steps in.\nDeparting from an improved conceptualization of what does and does not constitute a `sovereignty referendum’, the Contested Sovereignty dataset records the worldwide incidence of sovereignty referendums from 1776-2012. Drawing on a rich set of sources, the dataset identifies a total of 602 sovereignty referendums, more than double the number in existing lists.

More cantons soon followed, and as of this writing expatriates from 12 out of the 26 cantons can vote online. This paper focuses on the second phase involving expatriates. We address three questions at the core of the internet voting research agenda. First, the popularity question: to what extent do expatriates make use of the new online channel? Second, the ‘who’ question: what is the profile of the typical expatriate i-voter? Finally, the turnout question: did the extension of internet voting to the expatriates have an effect on electoral mobilization? Our findings indicate that the online channel is very popular among expatriates, both if compared to other trials in Switzerland itself and internationally. On the other hand, known patterns regarding the profile of i-voters and the effect on mobilization seem to be also replicated in the expatriate trials. Expatriate i-voters tend to be young, male, and there is some evidence of an upper-class bias. Thus, usage of the online channel seems driven by the digital divide also among expatriates. Moreover, we find some evidence that i-voting did not affect electoral mobilization, similarly to trials involving residents.","tags":[],"title":"Internet Voting for Expatriates: The Swiss Case","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Micha Germann","Flurin Conradin","Christoph Wellig","Uwe Serdült"],"categories":["Published"],"content":"","date":1400630400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1400630400,"objectID":"0828c36a4ccd512b09b79ce3e80def4e","permalink":"https://michagermann.github.io/publication/germannconradinwelligserduelt2014/","publishdate":"2019-09-14T18:19:30+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/germannconradinwelligserduelt2014/","section":"publication","summary":"Initially targeted at residential voters only, Swiss internet voting trials have recently been extended to expatriates.
